# Culmae: Sinatra Project

This project keeps track of an employee or candidate, a note about them, and allows for a rating on their "tact". Eventually this program will allow somoene to keep track of many more qualities of an individual.

### Prerequisites

You have to be an instructor (that's you), a recruiter or HR professional. 

### Installing

There are no automated tests for this application.

I have to figure that out first! I'll get back to you.
